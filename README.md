# Classifying-Breast-Cancer-with-Quantum-Machine-Learning-using-IBM-Qiskit
  Breast cancer is a common and often aggressive form of cancer that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis is key to successful treatment, and machine-learning techniques have been widely used to help classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. This blog post will explore how quantum machine learning can classify breast cancer using the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. In the first article of this two-part series, we will introduce the quantum kernel method, and in the second, we will show how to implement a variational quantum circuit for the same task. We will use the IBM Qiskit library to implement these techniques on a quantum simulator and a quantum computer.
### Introduction
  Quantum machine learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses quantum computers to perform machine learning tasks. It can provide significant improvements in the speed and accuracy of machine learning algorithms, particularly for tasks that are difficult or impossible to achieve with classical computers.
  
  One of the main reasons that quantum machine learning is a commonly asked topic is that quantum computers have the potential to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. In particular, quantum computers can perform certain linear algebra operations, such as matrix inversion and eigenvalue decomposition, exponentially faster than classical computers. This makes them well-suited to tasks such as data classification and clustering, which rely heavily on linear algebra operations.
  
  Quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. A bit is the most basic unit of classical information, and it can represent either a 0 or a 1. A bit is usually implemented using an electrical or optical signal, and it is used to store and transmit information in classical computers.
  
  A qubit is the most basic unit of quantum information, and it can represent a 0, a 1, or any linear combination of these states. A qubit is usually implemented using a quantum system, such as an atom, a nucleus, or a photon, and it is used to store and transmit information in quantum computers.
  
  One key difference between bits and qubits is that qubits can exist in a superposition of states, which means that they can represent multiple states simultaneously. Entanglement is another fundamental property of quantum systems that describes the correlations that exist between different quantum states. When two or more quantum systems are entangled, their states are correlated in such a way that measuring one system affects the other systems. These two properties allow quantum computers to perform certain types of computation much faster than classical computers, and it is one of the main reasons why quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize computing.
  
  There are many types of quantum machine learning. However, this post will concentrate on the quantum kernel method. This method uses quantum computers to compute the kernel function in kernel-based machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs). The kernel function is a measure of similarity between pairs of data points. It maps the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear boundary can separate it. Using a quantum computer to compute the kernel function makes it possible to perform this mapping much faster than with a classical computer, which can improve the performance of the machine-learning algorithm.
  
  In the next few steps, we will walk through the python program for this project.
